## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
* The virtual environment [.starbucks_env](https://github.com/hongtranthianh/Starbucks-Promotion-Analysis/tree/main/.starbucks_env) contains all Python packages to run all notebooks and `.py` file.
* The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. Currently using `Python 3.11.3` on `Windowns 11`.

## 1. Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>

### 1.1. Background information <a name="background-info"></a>
This project is a real experiment from Starbucks and provided as a take-home assignment for their job candidates. For a full description of what Starbucks provides to candidates see the [instructions available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18klca9Sef1Rs6q8DW4l7o349r8B70qXM/view).

Starbucks had a promotion program and wanted to test if this program would bring more customers to purchase a specific product priced at $10. Since it costs the company 0.15 to send out each promotion, Starbucks needed to limit that promotion to only those that had the likelihood to purchase.

**How did Starbucks facilitate the expriment of the promotion program?**
- Divide the customers into two groups:
    + `Treatment group`: customers were received promotion
    + `Control group`: customers were NOT received promotion
- Observe customer behavior in `Treatment group` against `Control group`, test if there's any positive effect of desirable metrics on `Treatment group` and decide to launch the promotion program.

### 1.3. Objectives <a name="objective"></a>

1. Analyze the effect of the promotion program on two metrics: `Incremental Response Rate (IRR)` and `Net Incremental Revenue (NIR)`.
2. Build a classification model to select best customers for the promotion program in a way that maximizes `IRR` and `NIR`.
